# API-Vocab-Quiz
Created by Tianna DeSpain

1. Overview:
A word definition quiz web application using Node.js, CSS, and HTML. The application will leverage a free dictionary API to provide word definitions and allow users to take quizzes. Users will have the option to log in and save their quiz scores for future reference.

2. Audience:
The target audience for this web application includes language learners, students, and individuals interested in expanding their vocabulary. The application will provide an interactive and engaging platform for users to test their word knowledge and improve their understanding of word definitions.

3. Data Sources:
The web application will utilize the following data sources:
- External API: A free dictionary API will be integrated to fetch word definitions and related data for the quiz questions.
- localStorage: The user's login credentials and quiz scores will be stored locally using the browser's localStorage feature. This will allow users to access their scores even after closing the application.
- Local JSON file: A local JSON file will be used to store additional quiz questions and answers. This will provide flexibility in adding custom quiz content apart from the data obtained from the API.

4. Initial Module List:
The project will be divided into several modules to ensure modularity and maintainability. The initial module list includes:
- User Authentication: Implementing user registration and login functionality to manage user accounts. (Alternatively, might use Google OAuth)
- Quiz Interface: Creating a quiz interface that presents questions and multiple-choice options.
- Dictionary API Integration: Integrating the free dictionary API to fetch word definitions and related data.
- Quiz Scoring and Results: Implementing the scoring mechanism for quizzes and displaying the results to the user.
- Score Saving: Allowing users to save their quiz scores for future reference.

5. Schedule:
To stay on track and meet the project deadline of July 19th, a schedule with mile-markers will be established. The schedule will include specific tasks and milestones, such as:
- Week 1 (June 15 - June 21): Project setup, API research, basic HTML files, and initial UI design.
- Week 2 (June 22 - June 28): User authentication implementation, including registration and login functionality.
- Week 3 (June 29 - July 5): Quiz interface development, integrating the dictionary API, and fetching word definitions.
- Week 4 (July 6 - July 12): Scoring mechanism implementation, displaying quiz results, and allowing users to save their scores.
